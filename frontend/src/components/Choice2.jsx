      <h2>General ward</h2>
      <h4>Purpose</h4>
      <p>Cost-Effective Care: General wards are designed to provide affordable healthcare. The cost is generally lower compared to private or semi-private rooms, making them accessible to a wider population.
      Standard Care: Patients in general wards receive the same standard of medical care as those in private rooms. The difference lies primarily in the level of privacy and certain amenities.
      </p>
      <h4>Layout and Features</h4>
      <p>Multiple Beds: General wards usually contain several beds in a single room. The number of beds can vary, but it typically ranges from 4 to 30, depending on the hospital's capacity and design.
Shared Facilities: Patients share facilities such as bathrooms, washrooms, and sometimes even televisions or other entertainment options.
Privacy: Privacy is limited in general wards, with patients often separated by curtains or partitions. This setup may be less comfortable for some, especially those who value quiet or need rest in a more private setting.
Nursing Care: There is usually a higher nurse-to-patient ratio compared to private rooms, meaning that nurses and other healthcare providers are attending to more patients at once.</p>
      <h4>Patient Demographics</h4>
      <p>Wide Range of Conditions: Patients with various medical conditions are treated in general wards, except for those requiring specialized care, such as intensive care units (ICUs) or maternity wards.
      Post-Surgery Recovery: General wards often accommodate patients who are recovering from surgery and do not need intensive monitoring.</p>
      <h4>Who Typically Uses General Wards?</h4>
      <p>Public Healthcare Systems: In many countries with public healthcare systems, general wards are the primary option for inpatients, especially those who are not covered by private insurance or cannot afford private care.
      Low-Risk Patients: Patients with stable conditions that do not require intensive monitoring are often placed in general wards.</p>
      <h4>Advantages</h4>
      <p>Social Interaction: Some patients appreciate the company of others, finding comfort in the presence of fellow patients, which can be a source of emotional support.
      Accessibility: In public hospitals, general wards are often the most readily available, especially in regions where healthcare resources are stretched thin.</p>
      <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
      <p>Limited Privacy: The lack of privacy is a significant downside for many patients, as multiple people share the same room and facilities.
Noise and Disruptions: The presence of multiple patients can lead to a noisier environment, which might disrupt rest and recovery.
Risk of Infection: While hospitals maintain strict hygiene standards, the close proximity of patients increases the risk of hospital-acquired infections.</p>
