# SIH Problem Statement Title : Queuing models in OPDs/ availability of beds/ admission of patients. A hospital based solution is ideal which can be integrated with city wide module

## Description : Technological solution as per queuing models in OPDs/availability of beds/admission of patients would be one area. Study of dispensation of various types of medicines/consumables and Inventory management modules at hospital level are key areas requiring support. NIC has already developed some modules but their implementation in Delhi is yet to be started. A hospital based solution is ideal which can be integrated with city wide module may be required.

This project is a Hospital Management System (HMS) built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). The system is designed to manage various aspects of hospital operations, including patient admissions, bed management, outpatient department (OPD) queues, and inventory management for medicines and consumables.

## Project Overview

### Features

- Patient Admission & Bed Management: Manage patient admissions, assign beds, and track bed availability in real-time.
- OPD Queuing System: Handle outpatient appointments, manage patient queues, and ensure efficient routing to the correct departments.
- Inventory Management: Track inventory levels of medicines and consumables, automate reorder processes, and receive alerts for low stock.
- Data Security: Implement role-based access control and data encryption to protect sensitive patient information.

### Technology Stack

- MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing patient records, bed availability, and inventory data.
- Express.js: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build the backend API services.
- React.js: Front-end library for building interactive user interfaces and managing the presentation layer.
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime used for building the backend server and handling API requests.
